# 8x1 Multiplexer (MUX) - VLSI Design Project

## Overview
This repository contains the VLSI design and simulation results of an 8x1 Multiplexer (MUX) implemented using Cadence tools. The project includes schematic design, ADE simulations, power analysis, symbol representation, and stick diagrams.

## Project Components
### 1. Schematic Design
The schematic of the 8x1 MUX is created using Cadence Virtuoso. It represents the transistor-level implementation of the multiplexer.
