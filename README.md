# 8x1 Multiplexer (MUX) - VLSI Design Project

## Overview
This repository contains the VLSI design and simulation results of an 8x1 Multiplexer (MUX) implemented using Cadence tools. The project includes schematic design, ADE simulations, power analysis, symbol representation, and stick diagrams.

## Project Components
### 1. Schematic Design
The schematic of the 8x1 MUX is created using Cadence Virtuoso. It represents the transistor-level implementation of the multiplexer.

## MOSFET Usage
A total of **72 MOSFETs** were used in the design:
- **8** transistors per input for the NAND gate.
- **2** transistors per inverter of the selection pin.
- **2** transistors for inverting NAND output to AND.
- **16** transistors for the NOR gate.
- **2** transistors for the final NOT gate used in the OR gate input.

Additionally, **PMOS transistors were twice the size of NMOS transistors** to balance drive strength and performance.
